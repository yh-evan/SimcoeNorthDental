## Project Description

Simcoe North Dental is a brand-new dental office located on one of the busiest streets of Oshawa. The clinic has a space of 1600 square feet and is equipped with four state-of-the-art dental operatories. Dr. Hu has extensive clinical experience and obtained a Doctor of Dental Surgeon degree in Dentistry from the University of Toronto.     

Create a flexible, educational system that is easy to maintain, and programmers develop a friendly system that can deliverâ€”reliable clinics and services to our key clients. In addition to designing a user-friendly system with an intuitive interface, we must also develop a web-based, database-driven administration tool that allows dentists and clients to join live clinics quickly.
