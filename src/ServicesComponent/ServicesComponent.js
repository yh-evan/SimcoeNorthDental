              Missing teeth can influence your chewing function and appearance.
              Bridges and Dentures are traditional ways of restoring the missing
              teeth. Either has different pros and cons. Consult our dentists
              for more information to make your right decision.

              Crowns and Veneers are artificial dental restoration methods that
              can improve or restore the look and functions of teeth. They can
              be used on teeth with extensive structural loss or after root
              canal treatment to make them stronger, or be used to improve the
              shape or color of the teeth for the cosmetic purpose.

              Dental implants are made of titanium metal. They are placed into
              the jawbone to replace the roots of missing teeth. They support
              artificial replacement teeth to restore missing teeth. Comparing
              with the bridges and dentures, they have their unique advantages
              and become the main method of replacing missing teeth in recent
              years.

              For hopeless teeth, they need to be taken out to reduce the risk
              of infection, pain, or even bone resorption. Sometimes, there are
              other reasons for an tooth extraction, for example, wisdom teeth
              extraction or suggestions from an orthodontist. Check with our
              dentists before you make a decision.

            <Card.Text>
              sometimes when you have a deep cavity or cracked tooth, the pulp
              inside the tooth may be involved. To save the tooth, dentists may
              suggest root canal treatment (also called endo treatment) for it.
              Root canal treatment includes removing infected or injured pulp
              from inside the crown and roots of a tooth, then filling the roots
              with dental material. It is quite common that a crown restoration
              will be recommended to the same tooth after the root canal
              treatment.
